/**
 * Nextbillion.ai Distance Matrix API computes distances and ETAs between a set of origins and
 * destinations â€” could be for one-to-many or many-to-many scenarios. The API call returns a matrix
 * of ETAs and distances for each origin and destination pair. For example, If the set is Origins
 * {A,B} and Destinations {C,D,E} we can get the following set of results with distance (meters) and
 * time (seconds) for each. The GET method can only handle up to 100 locations (1 location is either
 * 1 origin or 1 destination).
